# Detection framework

The purpose of the Detection framework is to generalize artificial text detection approaches.

At the current stage this framework provides the support of:

- Datasets from [tatoeba](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatoeba);
- Models from [EasyNMT](https://github.com/UKPLab/EasyNMT).

Here is a list of supported languages:

| Source language  | Target Language | Dataset |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Deutch | English | Tatoeba |
